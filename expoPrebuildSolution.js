The issue stemmed from an incorrectly configured environment variable, `PATHEXT`. This variable dictates which file extensions Windows considers executable. To resolve the issue, ensure that `.cmd` is included in the PATHEXT variable.  You can typically do this through the system environment variables settings. After adjusting the `PATHEXT` variable, the `expo prebuild` command successfully completed.
